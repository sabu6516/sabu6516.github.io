                            The one thing our founder Samuel loves more than catching a fine sloppy mouth is doing the same thing irresponsibly. 
                            Through <i>days</i> of hard<i>ish</i> work, he and his team have begun the SMF Project, which will become the ultimate Slopperman's dream.
                            In Sam's spare time he dreams of catching a monster with the frog, or burning ticks in an industrial oven.
                            When contacted to give a pre-fishing interview for our website, he simply stated: <i>Sleep well sloppies, tommorows'a fishin' frenzy.</i>

                            <br><br>
                            As innovative as he is charming, Jakob is always pushing the sloppy tech to it's limit. His internal Slopdarâ„¢ allows him to know when and where the sloppies are biting.
                            A master of every lure, no fish is too big, although some may be too small. Disapointed with small fry, Jakob is always aiming for the highest heights of sloppys.
